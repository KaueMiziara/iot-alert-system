# Preventive maintenance on ESP32
Simple IoT project created for a Computer Engineering class using embedded Rust.  

The purpose of this project was to use an ESP32 to read data from an accelerometer and temperature sensor, sounding an alarm if the readings exceed a defined limit.
A similar concept could be applied to monitor machines, alerting the staff in case of overheating or mechanical stresses, indicating possible malfunctions before
the equipment becomes inoperable.
